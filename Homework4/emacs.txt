This mergepoint M at 7dd52bfd8e503316b4aa9c5767850d3985626b26 was made 
on 10-17-2020 at 09:49:54 by Glenn Morris, with email rgm@gnu.org.
The mergepoint M was to merge from origin/emacs-27. Its two parents were 
to merge from origin/emacs-27 and improve documentation of 
'Info-hide-note-references' in info.texi. M merged these two commits 
together, and from then on it was the final merge for a while.
It has one child: fix bad dimensions of initial frame on VcXsrv.
The merge was made to merge the master branch, the 
remotes/origin/feature/native-comp branch, and the remotes/origin/master.
The mergepoint's two parents merged from origin/emacs-27 and an
admin/release-process that added notes from update files to upstream, so 
overall, the mergepoint merged from origin/emacs-27, this 
admin/release-process, and improved documentation of 
'info-hide-note-references' in info.texi.
The top left window shows a colored diagram of the branches and commits made.
The other subwindows show who made the commits, at what time, a log of the
commits that describes the author, commiter, parent and child commits, 
branches, and another subwindow that shows the actual changes made 
(what git diff would show).

The differences between the cloned GNU Emacs git repository from Savannah 
and the repository in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs is seen when executing the
command git branch. The list of all branches for the repository from
Savannah is just *master, whereas there are 34 branches in the
repository in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs. There are branches for different emacs 
version (emacs-23, 24, 25, 26, 27), features (like feature/byte-switch), 
fixes (like fix/bug-2034), old-branches, other-branches, scratch branches, 
and plenty of other miscellaneous branches like wallet, z100, x-tabs,
and more, in addition to * master. It seems like the Savannah repository
is much more streamlined and much less cluttered. Also, Eggert's repo
is of an older version of emacs. Using git log, we can see that the latest 
commit for the cloned Savannah repository is November 13, 2020, whereas
the latest commit for Eggert's repository is November 3, 2020.
