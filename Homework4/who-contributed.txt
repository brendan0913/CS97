Used the search command C-s in Emacs to search for "Even newspaper reports 
present contradictory information."
Began searching in the source files without filename extensions (I rightfully
assumed that this line would not be in a file with a filename extension,
like .c, .awk, .h, etc.)
      I also did not bother checking the files with capitalized names 
      (README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, etc.)
Found the problematic line in northamerica
Used command git blame northamerica
Searched for "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." 
using C-s
Found c8f960ec (Paul Eggert        2013-09-02 08:09:06 -0700  890) # and 
wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
It seems that Paul Eggert improperly cited this quote from his book when he
copied it in on September 2nd, 2013 at 8:09:06
Used command git log c8f960ec to see why this commit was made. The commit
at 8:09:06 was made to move links back to their primary files, and the 
commit 7 hours earlier was to improve citation to Morrison & Stephenson.
Clearly, Eggert did not improve this citation enough.
