Homework 2

Exercise 2.1: Navigating through Emacs source code

(expt 2 (expt 3 4))

The number does not fit into a 64 bit expression, as shown by:
(< (expt 3 4) 63)
nil

C-h k C-h k opens the *Help* buffer that describes what C-h k does; this command runs the 
command describe-key (explains what the keystroke does); the help buffer opens up because
C-h k is the command to open the help buffer which describes what the inputted key does

C-h k M-SPC also opens up the *Help* buffer that describes what M-SPC does, which runs
the command just-one-space, which, makes just one space (removes all spaces except for one
in between words, or adds a space if there is none)

Homework: Python scripting
When randline.py is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, it produces an IndexError
due to the function chooseline() which returns random.choice(self.lines). If the sequence
is empty (the empty file /dev/null produces an empty sequence), and IndexError is raised

When randline.py is run with python3 instead of python, an SyntaxError is produced, due
to invalid syntax. This is because the update from Python 2 to 3 updated the syntax, such
as having to write print(x) instead of print x. The aforementioned syntax error is also
due to incorrect parentheses that would be correct in Python 2.

When my script shuf.py is run with Python 2, most of the commands output the same, but for 
example, one difference I found is that Python 2 is unable to run repeat infinitely
(called without -n), whereas Python 3 outputs the positional args infinitely. Python 2
calls a MemoryError with sys.maxsize (used to output lines infinitely), whereas Python 3
doesn't.
